This is a simple Pokédex application built with Python.

To run the program, you will need the following dependencies installed:
  - Python version 3.14 or higher
  - DearPyGui version 2.1.1 or higher
  - Pandas version 2.3.3 or higher
  - Matplotlib version 3.10.8 or higher

If you do not already have Python installed, you can download the latest version from:
https://www.python.org/downloads

Once Python is installed, you can install the latest version of the required libraries by running the following commands in Command Prompt:

  - pip install pandas matplotlib
  - pip install dearpygui

If you receive an error saying that the pip command is not recognised, use these commands instead:

  - py --m pip install pandas matplotlib
  - py --m pip install dearpygui

After installing the dependencies, the application can be run directly through VS Code or any other Python-compatible IDE.
